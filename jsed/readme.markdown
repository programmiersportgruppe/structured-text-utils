# Compiling jsed

* `jsed` depends on the spidermonkey library being available on your machine.

*  The `fetch-dependencies.sh` script can be used to download, compile and install
   spidermonkey (watch out there is a `sudo make install` in there).

* To compile and run basic tests use the `build.sh` script provided. Please note that potentially
  you might have to fix the include and the lib path.

* The `install.sh` script can be used to install jsed
